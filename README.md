Speech In Noise (SIN) Software Package
===

Overview
--------

SIN is a software package that has been used to run many behavioral tests, including basic psychoacoustic and highly demanding audiological paradigms. For example, we have used SIN to do everything from basic playback and recording to administering audiovisual clinical tests like the Multimodal Lexical Sentence Test (MLST) developed by Karen Kirk and colleagues at the University of Iowa (http://www.flintbox.com/public/project/23463). 

The package is written primarily in MATLAB and leverages PsychToolBox (http://psychtoolbox.org/) to create a uniform testing environment with virtually any hardware setup. 

Background
------

SIN was initially developed for a multi-site project with the University of Washington and University of Iowa. The project required experimenters to administer approximately 30 - 40 individual audio or audiovisual tasks in a highly reproducible way with minimal inter-experimenter variance. The goal of SIN was to create a flexible and uniform platform upon which all tests could be administered, scored, and stored. 

Design
------

SIN is comprised of four major types of functions.

1. _Players_
  + asdf
2. _Modification Checks_
3. _Modifiers_
4. _Analyses_

Installation Dependencies
