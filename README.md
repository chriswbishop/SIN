Speech In Noise (SIN) Software Package
===

Overview
--------

SIN is a software package that has been used to run many behavioral tests, including basic psychoacoustic and highly demanding audiological paradigms. For example, we have used SIN to do everything from basic playback and recording to administering audiovisual clinical tests like the Multimodal Lexical Sentence Test (MLST) developed by Karen Kirk and colleagues at the University of Iowa (http://www.flintbox.com/public/project/23463). 

The package is written primarily in MATLAB and leverages PsychToolBox (http://psychtoolbox.org/) to create a uniform testing environment with virtually any hardware setup. 

I developed SIN while working on a multi-site project at the University of Washington and University of Iowa.
