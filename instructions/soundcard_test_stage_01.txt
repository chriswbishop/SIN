*Disconnect all speakers/headphones!!!*

The sound that is about to play will be *very* loud. 

A 1-kHz tone will be presented from all channels simultaneously. 

Hook up the sound card output to an oscilloscope.

Verify that all channels are a perfect match. 

- Are there time delays?

- Are there level differences?
